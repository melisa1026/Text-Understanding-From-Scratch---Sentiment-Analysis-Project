### Description:
This repository contains an executable file to run the replicated model. 

You can also view the model training and creation in the folder "Model Training and Evaluation. It contains two models:
- the CNN text character-level reproduced the original paper
- a BERT model for comparison

Both models use the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset/data
